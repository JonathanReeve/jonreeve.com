</h1><article><p>Posted 2015-03-15</p><p>Digital humanists working in computational text analysis need a
better way to share corpora. Following is a rough sketch of a way to
share texts in way that facilitates collaboration, provides for easy
error correction, and adheres as much as possible to decentralized,
open-source, and open-access models.</p>
<h1 id="problems">Problems</h1>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-corpus-availability">The Problem of Corpus
Availability</h2>
<p>Franco Moretti gave a talk at NYU two weeks ago, detailing digital
analyses he had conducted on large numbers of novels. The handout he
circulated beforehand, whose authors also included Mark Algee-Hewitt,
Sarah Allison, Marissa Gemma, Ryan Heuser, and Hannah Walser, included a
section about the difficulty of obtaining many of these corpora:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In August, requests were sent to Hathi and Gale – with both of which
Stanford [has] a solid, long- standing agreement – for their 300
volumes; two months later, we haven’t yet received anything. Of the 100
existing only in print, about half were held by the British Library, in
London, which just a few months earlier had kindly offered the Literary
Lab a collection of 65,000 digitized volumes from its collections;
unfortunately, none of the books we were looking for was in this corpus.
The special collections at UCLA and Harvard (which held about 50 of the
100 books) sent us a series of estimates that ranged (depending, quite
reasonably, on the conditions of the original, and on the photographic
requirements, that could be possibly very labor-intensive) from $1,000
to $20,000 per novel; finally, six novels were part of larger
collections held by Proquest, which offered us a very generous 50%
discount; even so, those six books would have cost us $147,000, or
$25,000 per title.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unreasonable that a text that has long been out of copyright
would cost researchers $25,000, and that this represents a 50% discount
on the usual rate. The very premise that public-domain works are held
captive by for-profit institutions is one that seems at odds with the
ideals of science and academia—it greatly obstructs the repeatability of
experiments in text analysis, and sets the barrier for entry into the
field unnecessarily high. I asked Prof. Moretti if he had any ideas
about how to minimize this problem, and he answered that there were
legal reasons why he couldn’t provide texts from his corpus to other
researchers. Stanford had particular agreements with these data
providers, and if I wanted to use that data, I would first need to be
affiliated with an institution that could strike corpus sharing
agreements with the data providers, and then make agreements with the
data providers through that institution. Those are major hurdles for an
independent scholar who wishes to do large-scale text analysis.</p>
<p>The problem of corpus availability is deep and pervasive. At last
year’s Digital Humanities conference, I saw a fantastic presentation by
the Stanford Literary Lab on the detection of poetic meter. Since they
had analyzed a set of texts from the Literature Online (LION) database,
I asked them how they were able to get permissions for that data set.
They replied that they’d simply asked ProQuest for it. With this in
mind, I contacted John Pegum at ProQuest, in the hopes of obtaining
texts I might use for large-scale analyses. His reply was polite and
thorough, but concluded that I very likely couldn’t afford to pay for
this privilege. When I responded with a few other options—one of which
was working directly on a server of their choosing, without making a
copy of the text—I never received a reply.</p>
<p>Even some of the best text repositories, like the <a
href="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/">Oxford Text Archive</a>, are designed in
such a way as to make them prohibitively difficult to use for
macroanalysis. Many of the texts in the Oxford archive are behind a
permissions wall, and seemingly by default. To gain access to a text, a
researcher must apply to Oxford and specifically request a particular
text. If that scholar is then interested in analyzing hundreds of texts,
that would require hundreds of requests.</p>
<p>This problem was one of the major topics of discussion at the
workshop Computer-Based Analysis of Drama I attended last week in
Munich. Many of the presenters used texts from the TextGrid repository,
and it was suggested that this could be a platform for the sharing of
corpora among researchers. Yet TextGrid is apparently losing funding
soon, and might go down. So how can we find a common platform for
sharing texts, so that others might benefit from them?</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-corpus-immutability">The Problem of Corpus
Immutability</h2>
<p>Another issue with the current paradigms for the sharing of corpora
is the problem of corpus immutability. If texts are only available from
a centralized source, then new versions of that text depend on the
maintainers of that centralized source for all changes. Corpora of
scanned texts are full of OCR errors, and there are few opportunities
for user corrections of those errors. Project Gutenberg handles this
problem with volunteer proofreaders, but the fundamentally static nature
of their web pages makes it difficult for those outside of their
infrastructure to contribute textual corrections. At Computer-Based
Analysis of Drama, Martin Muller of Northwestern University demonstrated
a fantastic system for crowdsourced correction of these errors, <a
href="http://annolex.at.northwestern.edu/">Annolex</a>, that is the one
of the best such systems I’ve seen. Yet, at the moment, it only works on
a select number of early modern English texts. How can we make this sort
of crowdsourced error correction even more democratic, and even more
distributed?</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>What is needed is a platform for:</p>
<ul>
<li>easily and instantly uploading corpora for sharing among scholars
and researchers</li>
<li>tracking the versions of those corpora</li>
<li>collaboratively correcting texts in those corpora that contain OCR
or other errors</li>
<li>tracking problems with the texts, and openly discussing those
problems</li>
<li>allowing for the machine-readability of these corpora with a REST
API</li>
<li>adherence to an open-source and open-access philosophy</li>
<li>accomplishing all of the above with minimal programming</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="a-proposed-solution">A Proposed Solution</h1>
<p>Such a platform as described above has already long been in use among
coders, and would need only minor usage modifications to be used as a
plaform for sharing corpora. For those that aren’t already familiar with
it, <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a repository of
repositories, tightly integrated into the version control system <a
href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">git</a>,
where coders can <a
href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/">upload
their projects</a> and <a
href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">collaborate on
others’ projects</a>. Each repository features <a
href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">an issue tracker</a>,
wiki, and a statistics suite that can help you to see at a glace the
history of a project’s versions. It works very well already for handling
computer code, and would work just as well for handling text
corpora.</p>
<p>One of the best things about GitHub is its push-button forking
ability. To create a copy of any existing repository, just click the
“fork” button on that repository’s home page. This creates a copy of the
entire project that is now in your user account. You can make any
changes you like to your copy (even without leaving the browser), and
when you’re finished with your contributions, you can submit a pull
request to the original repo to request that your changes be merged into
the original project. This allows for distributed error-correction,
maintaining all the while the history of the contributions to the
text.</p>
<p>The web app generator platform <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>
uses GitHub for <a href="http://yeoman.io/generators/">their
decentralized generator collection</a>. Rather than manually maintain a
list of user-created generators, they dynamically search GitHub for any
repository with certain metadata, like the prefix <code
class="verbatim">generator-</code> or the keyword <code
class="verbatim">yeoman-generator</code>. Then they sort those
repositories by the number of times they’ve been starred. This approach
ensures that their list of generators is always up-to-date, and sorted
fairly democratically. This model could be applied to corpora.</p>
<p>I propose that we upload our corpora to GitHub, with repositories
named with the prefix <code class="verbatim">corpus-</code>. For
example, if I am uploading a corpus of Shakespeare TEI files, I might
name my repository <code class="verbatim">corpus-shakespeare-TEI</code>.
That repository could contain a set of TEI XML files, or a TEI corpus
file. This would ensure that the repository is as easily
machine-readable as it is human-readable.</p>
<p>Eventually, a scraping engine might be built which could, like
Yeoman’s generator list, dynamically search GitHub for any repo
beginning with <code class="verbatim">corpus-</code>. Then, performing
large-scale text analyses on any set of these corpora would be orders of
magnitude easier than manually assembling a database of texts.</p>
<h1 id="possible-concerns">Possible Concerns</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Although this is a decentralized solution when compared with
other, more static, repositories, GitHub is still a centralized hub.</p>
<ul>
<li>This might be solved by dynamically pulling repositories from a
number of similar git sources, like BitBucket.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>As Dario Kampkaspar reminded me, git has peculiarities with
diffing whitespace that might make it less than ideal for tracking
changes in XML.</p>
<ul>
<li>This might be solved by <a
href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9776527/merging-without-whitespace-conflicts">turning
on the <code class="verbatim">ignore whitespace</code> flag in
git</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>GitHub has <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota/">a
repository size limit of about 1GB, with a soft limit of about 100M per
file</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This might be solved by breaking up repositories into submodule
repositories. One parent corpus repo can hold several submodule
repos.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
