				<interp n="1">This sentence begins <foreign>in medias res</foreign>, as if the reader were joining a conversation that was already taking place. The word “and” also begins about thirty other sentences in the story, or roughly 5% of the story's sentences (see these calculations in <ptr target="https://github.com/JonathanReeve/corpus-mansfield-garden-party-TEI/blob/master/ands.ipynb">the “and” notebook</ptr>).

				<seg n="2">They could not have had a more perfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it.</seg>  
				<interp n="2">This is the first instance of the adjective “perfect” which will appear three times in the story, highlighting an implicit valuation of weather and other conditions that will be challenged by the carter's death. The absurd notion of ordering weather conditions, while of course not meant unironically, still suggests the imagined reach of the wealth depicted here. Mrs. Sheridan might almost believe, this line seems to say, that the weather conditions themselves might be controlled for a certain price. The implication, then, is that death, another force of nature, might also be controlled, so that it is not allowed to interfere with the perfection of the garden party.

				<seg n="3">Windless, warm, the sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light gold, as it is sometimes in early summer.</seg>
				<interp n="3">The day is “windless”; this contrasts with <ptr target="#48">L48</ptr> where “little faint winds were playing chase.” Since gold is usually a sign of wealth, this color word helps to paint the upper class setting of the story better than a word like “yellow.” The daisies on Laura's hat in <ptr target="#137">L137</ptr> are also gold.

				<seg n="4">The gardener had been up since dawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark flat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine.</seg>
				<interp n="4">Like the cook, the gardener is not named, but takes the name of his occupation (see also <ptr target="#75">L75</ptr>). Since “rosette” in this sense is a flower-shaped area, we see that there has been a transformation from the living flowers of the daisies to the dead (“dark”) patch of grass that bears only the shadow of a flower. The etymology of “rosette” further suggests a metaphorical transformation from daisies (perhaps associated with life in the symbolic economy of the hat in <ptr target="#137">L137</ptr>) to roses, “the only flowers that impress people,” according to <ptr target="#5">L5</ptr>.

				<seg n="5">As for the roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses are the only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only flowers that everybody is certain of knowing.</seg>
				<interp n="5">
					The roses, like workers from <ptr target="#15">L15</ptr>, are “impressive.” Davis notes that “it is with this view of flowers as socially useful that the workman's spontaneous appreciation of the lavender is contrasted,” referring to <ptr target="#30">L30</ptr>.

				<seg n="6">Hundreds, yes, literally hundreds, had come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down as though they had been visited by archangels.</seg>
				<interp n="6">This is the first instance of the word “green,” a major motif in the story. As in <ptr target="#2">L2</ptr>, the coincidence of the mass rose blooming with the garden party continues the suggestion that even nature conspires to make the garden party “perfect.” This is one of the factors that makes the carter's death all the more devastating.

We are never told what text or images the marquee shows, or whether it can be seen from the “mean cottages” at the bottom of the hill. If it is visible from these cottages, this may contribute to Laura's anxiety around <ptr target="#118">L118</ptr>, especially since Laura is acutely aware of the position of the marquee, helping to decide where to place it in <ptr target="#15">L15</ptr>-<ptr target="#29">29</ptr>.

					In a carnivalesque inversion of generational status, Mrs. Sheridan releases her authority for the duration of the party. This climaxes in <ptr target="#76">L76</ptr>, when she “echoes” Sadie's question “dreamily.” However, this inversion is not to last very long, since she becomes much more authoritative, and much less dreamy, by <ptr target="#78">L78</ptr>.

				</seg>
				<interp n="11">
					Laura's sisters Meg and Jose are introduced here, although Laura's brother Laurie won't be introduced until <ptr target="#38">L38</ptr>. Antony Alpers suggests that the names Meg, Jose, and Laurie may be an homage to characters with those names in Louisa May Alcott's novel <emph>Little Women</emph> (572). Meg and Jose are revealed to be dressed fashionably, both in traditional apparel of distant countries. Meg's “green turban” is either a literal turban, a fashionable adaptation of the middle eastern headdress, or a towel or other cloth wrapped in a similar way, as Mrs. Sheridan seems to suggest in <ptr target="#78">L78</ptr>, when she tells Meg to take the “wet thing” off of her head. The word “turban” may be etymologically related to “tulip” (_OED_, “turban”). That this is green enhances this botanical reference, and adds another image of floral blossoming that resonates with the theme of sexual awakening.

				</seg>
				<interp n="15">
					These workers are “impressive” to Laura, possibly for their physical strength (carrying “big tool-bags”) and their state of undress. The roses of <ptr target="#15">L15</ptr> are also described as “impressive.”

				<interp n="16">Laura wishes she was not as delicate, as attention-getting as a butterfly, attracting the smiles from these men that we see in <ptr target="#18">L18</ptr> and <ptr target="#19">L19</ptr>. Her blush might be used here to signal Laura's inability to reconcile her excitement for the men with her social position as their director and deputy employer. She might also feel embarrassed at her liminal state—interrupted in the middle of breakfast—a feeling which she tries to counterbalance by looking “severe.” Regarding Laura's attempt to “look severe and even a little bit short-sighted,” Kleine describes this as Laura's “practic[ing] adult faces” (365).

					“Good morning,” she said, copying her mother's voice. 
					But that sounded so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little girl, “Oh—er—have you come—is it about the marquee?”
				</seg>
				<interp n="17">
					Laura tries on a metaphorical adult hat in imitating her mother. (She will literally wear an adult's hat in <ptr target="#133">L133</ptr>.) Her stammering is another instance of interrupted speech. Robert Davis finds this scene to be essential of the story, arguing that “at the core of most scenes is Laura's attempt first to deal with other people or with experience on a mature level in a style—whether verbal or physical—learned from her mother; then her loss of confidence in that style; and finally her retreat to childish responses” (61). Thomas Day applies Bakhtin's discourse theory to the understanding of this passage, arguing that “if you can own another's words, by inflectng them with your own accents ... you can exert a degree of ownership over that other which affirms your status within a dominant social group” (130).

					“That's right, miss,” said the tallest of the men, a lanky, freckled fellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and smiled down at her. “That's about it.”
				</seg>
				<interp n="18">The man's freckles are a sign that he has spent time outdoors, and his straw hat, inexpensive and practical for the summer, is most likely a sign of his social class. That he smiles “down” on her doesn't merely suggest benign age-based condescension, but is a trigonometric indication of how close they must be standing for this angle to be significant. If we conservatively estimate that their height difference is one foot, and that looking “down” implies a downward angle of at least 20 degrees, then they're standing only 2.75 feet apart. If that angle is more pronounced, at 30 degrees, then they must be standing a mere 1.73 feet apart.

					to say. 
				</seg>
				<interp n="19">The details Laura notices in the man suggest her desirous gaze toward him. The emphasis she gives them, denoted by the exclamation point, further supports this view. The blue of the man's eyes is unlike the blue of the sky, which in <ptr target="#3">L3</ptr> is “veiled with a haze of gold,”

The final sentence here contains just two words, “the marquee.” They are Laura's reminder to herself to stay focused on her task (see also “the telephone” in <ptr target="#42">L42</ptr>).

					Laura's upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite

				</seg>
				<interp n="23">The onomatopoeic monosyllables of “bang” and “slap” may sound crude to Laura for the level of discourse suggested by their Anglo-Saxon etymology, and by the unnecessary violence they lend to the visual apprehension of the marquee. It is not that the workman isn't aware of more a more polite or Latinate synonym for “bang slap in the eye,” since he uses it (“conspicuous”) earlier in the lexia. Thus, his familiarity is signaled as an intentional and perhaps flirtatious choice. Laura recognizes this, although she doesn't find it unwelcome. Of the line “she did quite follow him,” Davis claims this is “a release from the stiffness of the adult role she has learned from her mother” (62).

					kind of silent splendour. Must they be hidden by a marquee?
				</seg>
				<interp n="28">In this thought, Laura corrects the specificity of the workman, substituting “trees” for “karakas.” Karaka trees are native to New Zealand—by no means a “desert” island, but an island nonetheless. Karakas bear clusters of highly poisonous yellow fruit. Like the blue sky which is “veiled” by the gold haze in <ptr target="#3">L3</ptr>, the trees are yellowed by this poisonous fruit. The perfect day, as well, will soon be interrupted with the news of the carter's death.

				<interp n="31">Laura's sexual desire blends with her desire for an authenticity that she believes exists across class lines.

				<interp n="39">Our introduction to Laura's brother Laurie portrays him as someone with an ease of speech evidenced by his use of New Zealand slang (“squiz” roughly means “look”). Day contends that “Mansfield's use of vernacular voices in 'The Garden Party' alludes to this dimension in ways that interrogate the power on which it is premised, the story enacting ... a drama of displacement and devolutionary identity, with the mother country and its colonial offspring as the macrocosmic protagonists or antagonists” (135).</interp>

				<interp n="40">Laura's syntactic construction asks her brother for emotional affirmation—the tag question “don't you” mirrors her final question “isn't life?". Severin argues that these tag questions “creates a façade of open dialogue by giving the appearance of soliciting opinion and presenting choice. In reality, however, these structures obtain assent by reducing the likelihood for challenge” (3). Although Severin may be right about the implications of some of these questions, such as Jose's “Aren't I in a good voice mummy?” of <ptr target="#72">L72</ptr>, his hypothesis doesn't seem as applicable in this lexia.
