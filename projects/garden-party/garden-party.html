				<td class="interp">This is the first instance of the adjective “perfect” which will appear three times in the story, highlighting an implicit valuation of weather and other conditions that will be challenged by the carter's death. The absurd notion of ordering weather conditions, while of course not meant unironically, still suggests the imagined reach of the wealth depicted here. Mrs. Sheridan might almost believe, this line seems to say, that the weather conditions themselves might be controlled for a certain price. The implication, then, is that death, another force of nature, might also be controlled, so that it is not allowed to interfere with the perfection of the garden party.

				<td class="interp">Like the cook, the gardener is not named, but takes the name of his occupation (see also <a href="#75">L75</a>). Since “rosette” in this sense is a flower-shaped area, we see that there has been a transformation from the living flowers of the daisies to the dead (“dark”) patch of grass that bears only the shadow of a flower. The etymology of “rosette” further suggests a metaphorical transformation from daisies (perhaps associated with life in the symbolic economy of the hat in <a href="#137">L137</a>) to roses, “the only flowers that impress people,” according to <a href="#5">L5</a>.

					The roses, like workers from <a href="#15">L15</a>, are “impressive.” Davis notes that “it is with this view of flowers as socially useful that the workman's spontaneous appreciation of the lavender is contrasted,” referring to <a href="#30">L30</a>.

We are never told what text or images the marquee shows, or whether it can be seen from the “mean cottages” at the bottom of the hill. If it is visible from these cottages, this may contribute to Laura's anxiety around <a href="#118">L118</a>, especially since Laura is acutely aware of the position of the marquee, helping to decide where to place it in <a href="#15">L15</a>-<a href="#29">29</a>.

					In a carnivalesque inversion of generational status, Mrs. Sheridan releases her authority for the duration of the party. This climaxes in <a href="#76">L76</a>, when she “echoes” Sadie's question “dreamily.” However, this inversion is not to last very long, since she becomes much more authoritative, and much less dreamy, by <a href="#78">L78</a>.

				</td>
				<td class="interp">
					Laura's sisters Meg and Jose are introduced here, although Laura's brother Laurie won't be introduced until <a href="#38">L38</a>. Antony Alpers suggests that the names Meg, Jose, and Laurie may be an homage to characters with those names in Louisa May Alcott's novel <span class="emph">Little Women</span> (572). Meg and Jose are revealed to be dressed fashionably, both in traditional apparel of distant countries. Meg's “green turban” is either a literal turban, a fashionable adaptation of the middle eastern headdress, or a towel or other cloth wrapped in a similar way, as Mrs. Sheridan seems to suggest in <a href="#78">L78</a>, when she tells Meg to take the “wet thing” off of her head. The word “turban” may be etymologically related to “tulip” (_OED_, “turban”). That this is green enhances this botanical reference, and adds another image of floral blossoming that resonates with the theme of sexual awakening.

				<td class="interp">Laura wishes she was not as delicate, as attention-getting as a butterfly, attracting the smiles from these men that we see in <a href="#18">L18</a> and <a href="#19">L19</a>. Her blush might be used here to signal Laura's inability to reconcile her excitement for the men with her social position as their director and deputy employer. She might also feel embarrassed at her liminal state—interrupted in the middle of breakfast—a feeling which she tries to counterbalance by looking “severe.” Regarding Laura's attempt to “look severe and even a little bit short-sighted,” Kleine describes this as Laura's “practic[ing] adult faces” (365).

					“Good morning,” she said, copying her mother's voice. 
					But that sounded so fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little girl, “Oh—er—have you come—is it about the marquee?”
				</td>
				<td class="interp">
					Laura tries on a metaphorical adult hat in imitating her mother. (She will literally wear an adult's hat in <a href="#133">L133</a>.) Her stammering is another instance of interrupted speech. Robert Davis finds this scene to be essential of the story, arguing that “at the core of most scenes is Laura's attempt first to deal with other people or with experience on a mature level in a style—whether verbal or physical—learned from her mother; then her loss of confidence in that style; and finally her retreat to childish responses” (61). Thomas Day applies Bakhtin's discourse theory to the understanding of this passage, arguing that “if you can own another's words, by inflectng them with your own accents ... you can exert a degree of ownership over that other which affirms your status within a dominant social group” (130).

					“That's right, miss,” said the tallest of the men, a lanky, freckled fellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and smiled down at her. “That's about it.”
				</td>
				<td class="interp">The man's freckles are a sign that he has spent time outdoors, and his straw hat, inexpensive and practical for the summer, is most likely a sign of his social class. That he smiles “down” on her doesn't merely suggest benign age-based condescension, but is a trigonometric indication of how close they must be standing for this angle to be significant. If we conservatively estimate that their height difference is one foot, and that looking “down” implies a downward angle of at least 20 degrees, then they're standing only 2.75 feet apart. If that angle is more pronounced, at 30 degrees, then they must be standing a mere 1.73 feet apart.

				</td>
				<td class="interp">The details Laura notices in the man suggest her desirous gaze toward him. The emphasis she gives them, denoted by the exclamation point, further supports this view.

				</td>
				<td class="interp">The onomatopoeic monosyllables of “bang” and “slap” may sound crude to Laura for the level of discourse suggested by their Anglo-Saxon etymology, and by the unnecessary violence they lend to the visual apprehension of the marquee. It is not that the workman isn't aware of more a more polite or Latinate synonym for “bang slap in the eye,” since he uses it (“conspicuous”) earlier in the lexia. Thus, his familiarity is signaled as an intentional and perhaps flirtatious choice. Laura recognizes this, although she doesn't find it unwelcome. Of the line “she did quite follow him,” Davis claims this is “a release from the stiffness of the adult role she has learned from her mother” (62).

				<td class="interp">In this thought, Laura corrects the specificity of the workman, substituting “trees” for “karakas.” Karaka trees are native to New Zealand—by no means a “desert” island, but an island nonetheless. Karakas bear clusters of highly poisonous yellow fruit. Like the blue sky which is “veiled” by the gold haze in <a href="#3">L3</a>, the trees are yellowed by this poisonous fruit.

Although Severin may be right about the implications of some of these questions, such as Jose's “Aren't I in a good voice mummy?” of <a href="#72">L72</a>, his hypothesis doesn't seem as applicable in this lexia.

					This is Laura's inner attempt to reconcile the mirth of the garden party with the morbid reality of the dead carter. Mansfield blends scenes from the party with a view of death as “sleeping,” and blends them so well that it is difficult to tell whether “happy... happy...” refers to the “they” who “were laughing” at the garden party or the dead carter whose face says “all is well.” Davis calls these lines “insistent repetition and sentimental metaphors” that “indicate the childishness of her thoughts,” but given the other references to sleeping and dreaming, and their associations, there is more to this metaphor than sentimentality (64).

					If Laura believes the dead man to be “happy” or “sleeping” per <a href="#192">L192</a>, then this would not elicit her sob.

					This is the “something” from <a href="#193">L193</a> that she must say to the dead carter. Her hat might be inappropriate to the somber occasion for its decorative gaiety (trimmed with gold daisies), but it could also be that it functions as a marker of adulthood, and given Laura's “childish sob” in <a href="#193">L193</a>, the hat seems out-of-place. Davis notices that Laura says “my hat” here, instead of “the ... hat,” from <a href="#174">L174</a>, arguing that “in accepting the hat ... she accepts intuitively its symbolic components,” namely, that it symbolizes the life represented by the garden party (65). Talyor suggests that in this moment Laura “rejects at last the meaningless dream of the garden party and stands now on the threshold of the real world, sinister at first, but now transmuted into beauty by the dream of death” (362).

					In true modernist fashion, the story ends without resolution, without answering this question. This is part of what, for Walker, “leaves readers with a feeling of dissatisfaction, a vague sense that the story somehow does not realize its potential” (354). As Severn puts it, this line “denies the reader access to what presumably would be a final, authoritative pronouncement regarding the outcome of the day's events” (2). Walker suggests that this question might be completed with “myserious, or surprising, or something else,” but a more likely answer, given indirectly by the song in <a href="#70">L70</a>, is “weary” (358).
